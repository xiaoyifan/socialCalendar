Folding Tab Bar and Tab Bar Controller

Made in [Yalantis](http://yalantis.com/).

Inspired by [this project on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2003376-Tab-Bar-Animation)

Also, read how it was done in our [blog](http://yalantis.com/blog/how_we_created_tab_bar_animation_for_ios/)

## Requirements
iOS 8.0

## Installation

####[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)
Will be available soon
```ruby
pod 'YALFoldingTabBar', '~> 1.0.0'
```

####Manual Installation

Alternatively you can directly add all the source files from FoldingTabBar folder to your project.

1. Download the [latest code version](https://github.com/Yalantis/FoldingTabBar.iOS/archive/master.zip) or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project. 
2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop all the folder directories in FoldingTabBar folder onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. 


##Introduction

####YALFoldingTabBarController
`YALFoldingTabBarController` is a subclass of `UITabBarController` with custom animating `YALFoldingTabBar`. 

####YALFoldingTabBar
YALFoldingTabBar is a subclass of a standard UIView. We wanted to make this component expand and contract in response to a user tapping. When the component is closed you can only see a central button (“+”). When tapping on it, our custom Tab Bar expands letting other tabBarItems appear, so that the user can switch the controllers.

Each separate tabBarItem can have two additional buttons on the left and right. These buttons can be used to let a user interact with a selected screen on the YALFoldingTabBarController without even having to leave it. 

####YALTabBarItem
`YALTabBarItem` is a model to configure your tab bar items with images. 


##Usage

Option 1: The simplest way is to use `YALFoldingTabBarController` as it is. You can also subclass it if you indend to change the default behaviour.

Option 2: You can write your own implementation of `UITabBarController `and use `YALFoldingTabBar` or its subclass.

Here is an instruction of how to use `YALFoldingTabBarController` in the Storyboard.

1. Add native `UITabBarController` to the storyboard, establish relationships with its view controllers.
2.  Choose `YALFoldingTabBarController` as custom class for `UITabBarController`.
3.  In AppDelegate method take out an instance of `YALFoldingTabBarController` from the window.rootViewController and supply it with images for the left and right tabBarItems respectively. Also you can add your own image for the center button of `YALFoldingTabBar`.

```objective-c
    YALFoldingTabBarController *tabBarController = (YALFoldingTabBarController *) self.window.rootViewController;

    //prepare leftBarItems
    YALTabBarItem *item1 = [[YALTabBarItem alloc] initWithItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"nearby_icon"]
                                                      leftItemImage:nil
                                                     rightItemImage:nil];
    
    
    YALTabBarItem *item2 = [[YALTabBarItem alloc] initWithItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"profile_icon"]
                                                      leftItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"edit_icon"]
                                                     rightItemImage:nil];
    
    tabBarController.leftBarItems = @[item1, item2];

    //prepare rightBarItems
    YALTabBarItem *item3 = [[YALTabBarItem alloc] initWithItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"chats_icon"]
                                                      leftItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"search_icon"]
                                                     rightItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"new_chat_icon"]];
    
    
    YALTabBarItem *item4 = [[YALTabBarItem alloc] initWithItemImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"settings_icon"]
                                                      leftItemImage:nil
                                                     rightItemImage:nil];

```

If you want to handle touches on extra tabBarItems import `YALTabBarInteracting` protocol to the subclass of the proper `UIVIewController` and implement these methods: 

```objective-c
- (void)extraLeftItemDidPressed;
- (void)extraRightItemDidPressed;
```
 If you want to observe contracting and expanding animation states in `YALFoldingTabBar` the following methods of `YALTabBarInteracting` protocol can be implemented:
```objective-c
- (void)tabBarViewWillCollapse;
- (void)tabBarViewWillExpand;

- (void)tabBarViewDidCollapsed;
- (void)tabBarViewDidExpanded;
```

##Important notes
Because we changed the height of the default `UITabBar` you should adjust your content to the bottom of  viewcontroller's superview, and ignore Bottom Layout Guide.  You should also uncheck 'Under bottom bars'  !['](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Owlcz.png)
You can see how we did it on the example project.

##Tips for customization
You can make the following configurations for custom tabBar:
Specify height :
```objective-c
tabBarController.tabBarViewHeight = YALTabBarViewDefaultHeight;
```  
2) Specify insets and offsets
```objective-c
    tabBarController.tabBarView.tabBarViewEdgeInsets = YALTabBarViewHDefaultEdgeInsets;
    tabBarController.tabBarView.tabBarItemsEdgeInsets = YALTabBarViewItemsDefaultEdgeInsets;
    tabBarController.tabBarView.offsetForExtraTabBarItems = YALForExtraTabBarItemsDefaultOffset;

```  
3) Specify colors
```objective-c
    tabBarController.tabBarView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:94.0/255.0 green:91.0/255.0 blue:149.0/255.0 alpha:1];
    tabBarController.tabBarView.tabBarColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:72.0/255.0 green:211.0/255.0 blue:178.0/255.0 alpha:1];
```  
4) Specify height for additional left and right buttons
```objective-c
    tabBarController.tabBarView.extraTabBarItemHeight = YALExtraTabBarItemsDefaultHeight;
```
